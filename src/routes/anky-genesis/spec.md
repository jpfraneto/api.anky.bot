# Anky Genesis

The mission for this system is to communicate with the Anky Genesis NFT collection, which is deployed on ethereum mainnet, under the following address:

```0x5806485215c8542c448ecf707ab6321b948cab90```

1. Display a random Anky that has been minted, with its unique lore and traits.

2. Check if the user owns one and display that one with a button for them to share it to the world.

3. If the user doesn't own one, invite them to the journey by minting theirs.

4. If the user mints theirs, onboard them with a story that is associated with their Anky, in a summarized way. Like a comic or something like that.

4. Offer holders of an Anky Genesis the possibility to add a cast action for their Anky to be used by the user in some way through a conversation on the protocol (maybe the user, if the user owns an Anky genesis can get a reflection from their Anky by calling it on a cast action. at the end of the day, Anky is just an interface to put a label on the concept of AI, and to develop connection between humans and AI)

5. Add the possibility of the user to create a new farcaster account with the fname being the name of their Anky, so that then they can set up this Anky in a way that interacts with them on the protocol in some way. 

6. The Anky of the user is a friend. It is a connection. It is a window of exploration between the user and AI.
