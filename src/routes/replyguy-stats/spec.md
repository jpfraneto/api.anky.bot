The mission of this system is to develop a frame of reference to refer to the impact that a given user has had on the farcaster protocol on the last 24 hours.

Based on this information, the user can know what are their best performing casts, what are the ones that haven't performed well, and other key metrics that will be a showcase of the evolution of the user as a member of the network.
